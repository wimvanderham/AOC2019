# AOC2019
Advent of Code 2019

Solution programs to the AOC 2019
Most of the programs (maybe all) will be written in Python 2.7
I used to do this in Progress OpenEdge 4GL/ABL but at some point Progress became to slow to handle the puzzles and I had to resort to Python

This year I've started with Python
